# nvimpp, tmuxpp, termpp – your terminal, your code, your style

Hello, I'm **vhstack** 👋

Welcome to my GitHub profile!

Here you'll find my personally curated projects designed to optimize your terminal experience, 
your coding workflow, and your personal style. Unlike many standalone setups you find online, 
these projects are intentionally tuned to complement each other visually, functionally, and 
with a focus on your daily workflow.

**Personalized terminal environment:**  
A tailor-made setup that combines colors, fonts, and tools seamlessly to customize your terminal experience to your liking.

## ✨ About Me

I've spent more time in the terminal than on social media over the years—and I've learned that good software development starts with 
a well-configured environment. With these projects, I aim to help others work efficiently and enjoyably in the terminal, whether 
in the shell or in tools like NeoVim.
